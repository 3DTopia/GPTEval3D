Our task here is the compare two 3D objects, both generated from the same text description. We will evaluate the models based on the aspects of Low-Level Geometry Details.

I will provide you with a specific view of two models, where the left part of it are image rendering and normal rendering of 3D object 1, and the right part denotes those of 3D object 2.

The evaluation of this aspect is built on the foundation that the geometry should accurately represent the intended shape. Note that meaningless noise is not considered as high-frequency details. Please focus on the local parts of the normal maps (do not consider the RGB part) and determine which one has a more well-organized and efficient structure, which one exhibits intricate details, and which one is more visually pleasing and smooth.

Provide a short analysis before giving final answer. The analysis should be very concise and accurate. Take a really close look at each of the multi-view images for these two 3D objects before providing your answer.

Make a decision using these three options:
1. Left (object 1) is better;
2. Right (object 2) is better;
3. Cannot decide.
IMPORTANT: PLEASE USE THE THIRD OPTION SPARSELY.

In the last row, summarize your final decision.

An example output looks like follows:
"
Analysis:
1. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

Final answer:
x (e.g., 1 / 2 / 3)
