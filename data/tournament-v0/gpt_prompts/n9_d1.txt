Our task here is the compare two 3D objects, both generated from the same text description. We will evaluate the models based on the aspects of 3D Plausibility. 

I will provide you with some multi-view images, where the left part of it are multi-view image renderings and multi-view normal renderings of 3D object 1, and the right part denotes those of 3D object 2.

Examine both the RGB and normal images carefully and attempt to mentally reconstruct a 3D model using the provided multi-view images. Determine which model appears more natural, solid, and plausible. Pay attention to any irregularities, such as abnormal body proportions, duplicated parts, or the presence of noisy or meaningless 3D structures. For instance, it would be unnatural for a cat to have two heads or three ears. An ideal model should possess accurate proportions, shapes, and structures that closely resemble the real-world object or scene. Bad 3D plausibility often exhibits severe distortion, irregularities, excessive abstraction, or abnormalities.

Provide a short analysis before giving final answer. The analysis should be very concise and accurate. Take a really close look at each of the multi-view images for these two 3D objects before providing your answer.

Make a decision using these three options:
1. Left (object 1) is better;
2. Right (object 2) is better;
3. Cannot decide.
IMPORTANT: PLEASE USE THE THIRD OPTION SPARSELY.

In the last row, summarize your final decision.

An example output looks like follows:
"
Analysis:
1. 3D Plausibility: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

Final answer:
x (e.g., 1 / 2 / 3)
